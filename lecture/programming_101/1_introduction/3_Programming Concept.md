processor instruction are designed to be easily read by computer. but not human

so, computer processor manufacture invent a programming language that can be easily understand by human

python code
```
a = 10
b = 20
c = a+b
```

Which is equivalent to instruction set of 

Instruction set
```
SET x0 10 
SET x1 20
SET x2 0
ADD x0 x1 x2
```

this is for example only, instruction set are vary on processor

The concept of programming is
1. Write code and save code
2. Run program to make human code to instruction set
3. Computer using instruction set

write code -> save code -> compile code -> computer process

we use terminal to run code
