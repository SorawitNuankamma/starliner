### Description
this course will introduce student to solving problem using computer programming and emphasize on solving in a procedure way
### Main Objective
Student get familiar with programming and using command line terminal
### Course Passing Criteria
Student must be proficient in programming language and use it to solve problem efficiently 

This course will ready you to be a programmer by paving foundation of basic concept of programming such as
- how computer keep data
- how computer processing
- basic to computer programming

in order to passed this course. student must be able to proved themself to be proficient in foundational programming and use it to solve problem correctly

definition
🧪 experiment -> encourage student to try it, but not enforce
🗳️ quiz -> mini submission
🌠 extra quiz -> more challange test, but not require
📝 test -> test against time with more challange, student must be well understand content before enter into test
📜 Project -> a project that need student file submission
